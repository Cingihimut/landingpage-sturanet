XTR is used for voting on campaign proposals, giving the community a voice in what causes are launched. It also enables users to bridge between XTR tokens and USX, a stablecoin used for making contributions. The platform prioritizes transparency and equal representation, ensuring that each user's vote counts equally, regardless of the number of tokens they hold.</p>

Itâ€™s purely based on the number of users participating in the vote. Whether you have a small or large amount of XTR, your voice carries the same weight. This ensures that every proposal reflects the true sentiment of the community.</p>

This makes it easy for users to move between holding tokens and actively supporting causes. Whether you're voting or contributing, the process is secure and efficient.</p>
