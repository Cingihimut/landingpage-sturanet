# Infrastruktur Smart Contract
Here are the key points related to smart contract infrastructure in crowdfunding implemented by Sturan Network:

### Crowdfunding Transaction Automation
    - Smart contracts manage the contribution process in crowdfunding campaigns automatically.
    - Contributions are in the form of USX (Stable coin) and are processed without the need for any other party's intervention, reducing the potential for manipulation.

### Execution Based on Certain Conditions
    - Smart contracts execute transactions only if certain conditions are met, such as:
        - Funding target achieved.
        - Campaign deadline met.
    - If conditions are not met, funds can be automatically returned to contributors.

### Transparency and Verification
    - All transactions made using smart contracts are recorded on the blockchain and can be verified by anyone.
    - Contributors can ensure that funds raised are delivered to the correct recipient address through transparent transactions.

### Secure Fund Management
    - Smart contracts ensure that funds raised in a campaign can only be withdrawn by campaign recipients if all conditions are met, increasing security and trust in fund management.
