# Infrastruktur Smart Contract
Our platform’s backbone is built on smart contracts, automating the transaction and contribution processes. This ensures that Sturan Network operates smoothly and transparently without human intervention.

### Crowdfunding Transaction Automation

    - Smart contracts manage the contribution process in crowdfunding campaigns automatically.
    - Smart contracts automate the entire crowdfunding process, from campaign creation to fund distribution, ensuring full transparency and efficiency.

### Execution Based on Certain Conditions
Contracts are executed only when specific pre-determined conditions are met, ensuring funds are distributed correctly and campaigns follow their set guidelines.

    - Smart contracts execute transactions only if certain conditions are met, such as:
        - Funding target achieved.
        - Campaign deadline met.
    - If conditions are not met, funds can be automatically returned to contributors.

### Transparency and Verification
Every transaction and contribution is publicly verifiable, allowing users to audit and confirm the proper use of funds. This enhances trust in the platform’s fairness.

    - All transactions made using smart contracts are recorded on the blockchain and can be verified by anyone.
    - Contributors can ensure that funds raised are delivered to the correct recipient address through transparent transactions.

### Secure Fund Management
    - With smart contracts, fund management becomes highly secure and automated. The system ensures that only authorized withdrawals occur, preventing fraud or misuse.

Sturan Network's smart contract infrastructure provides an automated, transparent and secure solution to manage all aspects of crowdfunding campaigns.
