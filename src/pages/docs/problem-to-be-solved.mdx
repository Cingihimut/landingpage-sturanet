# The problem to be solved

The aim is to overcome the problems of fraud and geographical limitations in traditional crowdfunding, such as cases of fraudulent donations that do not reach their destination.

## Transparency Issues in Traditional Crowdfunding

Crowdfunding, as a mechanism for raising funds for projects, initiatives or social causes, relies heavily on trust between contributors and campaign organizers. In traditional systems, this trust is often fragile due to the lack of direct access to monitor and verify the use of funds raised. Transparency becomes a serious issue as funds raised are often not used in accordance with the purpose announced to contributors. A real-life example presented in this article is the case of fraudulent donations for Palestine, where IDR 263 million was collected but not channeled to the correct destination, but instead sent to someone else.

## Transaction Security Issues

Besides transparency, transaction security is also a major issue in traditional crowdfunding systems. Centralized systems are usually vulnerable to various forms of attacks, including hacking, data misuse, or embezzlement of funds by irresponsible parties. When data and transactions are stored in one place, the system becomes an attractive target for hackers. In fact, if the platform is hacked, users' personal data and transaction information can fall into the wrong hands.

## Geographical and Currency Limitations

Another issue that often arises in traditional crowdfunding is geographical limitations. Different currencies in different countries are often an obstacle for international contributors who want to participate in crowdfunding campaigns. While the traditional banking system restricts people from transacting between countries, the difference in currencies means that users have to convert their currencies and incur conversion fees as well. With a sturan network, users do not need to convert their currency to fund a campaign.
