Joining as a volunteer in Sturan Network is a tangible step to contribute in creating change. Every hand involved, every step taken, is part of our journey together. Let's together realize the vision and mission of the community through real action, because at Sturan Network, every individual has an important role in creating a better future.

### Become a Volunteer at Sturan Network
    - At Sturan Network, your contribution doesn't just stop at voting or crowdfunding. You can also get directly involved by volunteering to help realize initiatives on the ground. However, to ensure that every action is targeted and transparent, every prospective volunteer must first register and pass a series of background checks.

### Real Action for Change
    - Proses ini bertujuan untuk menyeleksi volunteer secara baik dan memastikan bahwa dana serta sumber daya digunakan sesuai dengan tujuan yang telah disepakati oleh komunitas. Dengan demikian, Anda bisa yakin bahwa aksi Anda benar-benar berdampak dan terkoordinasi dengan baik.

After successfully passing the application process and background check, you will become part of a team dedicated to bringing about positive change. As a volunteer, you will have the opportunity to interact directly with the community, learn from real-life experiences, and see the impact of every effort made. Cooperation with fellow volunteers and the Sturan Network team will provide valuable experiences that not only enrich your knowledge, but also strengthen your sense of solidarity and togetherness.
