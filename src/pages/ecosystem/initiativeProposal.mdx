## Initiative Proposal
Communities also have the opportunity to submit initiative proposals to other communities. Through the on-chain governance mechanism, if the majority of the community approves the proposal, the campaign will be realized by the development team according to the details submitted. This ensures that every initiative proposed truly reflects the aspirations and needs of the community.

### Sturan Network Governance
    - In Sturan Network, every user has the power to contribute to the future of the project through on-chain governance. You can submit proposals for initiatives that you want to make happen, from simple ideas to significant changes. When submitting a proposal, users must lock their tokens during the voting period. These tokens will remain locked until the voting concludes, ensuring commitment to the proposal. If the majority of other users support your proposal through voting, then Sturanet Labs will take the next step and register the proposal as an official campaign.

### From Idea to Action, Together
    - Once registered, your proposal will be ready to crowdfund, giving the entire community the opportunity to fund and realize your proposed vision. All of this is done in a transparent and decentralized manner, ensuring that every major decision is driven by the community.
