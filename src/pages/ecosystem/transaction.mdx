# Transaction

The transaction flow in Sturan Network ensures transparency and security from the initiation to the final settlement of funds. Below is a step-by-step guide to understand how our system processes each transaction.

## Transaction Initiation

Transactions begin when users interact with the platform, whether by contributing to a campaign or initiating a wallet-to-wallet transfer.

    - ### Wallet
        A secure wallet is essential for interacting with Sturan Network. Users can store their tokens and initiate transactions directly from their wallet.

    - ### Transaction Submission
        Once initiated, transactions are submitted to the blockchain for validation. Our smart contracts ensure the submission process is transparent and tamper-proof.

## Transaction Settlement and Fund Distribution
After a transaction is validated, the smart contract distributes the funds as outlined in the campaign's terms. The transparency of the process ensures all stakeholders can monitor the flow of funds.

    - ### Funds Transfer
        Funds are securely transferred between wallets using blockchain. Every transfer is logged and can be audited, enhancing the trust in the platform.
    
    - ### Final Transaction
        Upon completion of all necessary validations and conditions, the final transaction is recorded on the blockchain, making it an immutable part of the systemâ€™s history.
