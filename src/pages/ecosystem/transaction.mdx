# Transaction

Transaction Flow in blockchain systems refers to how transactions are processed from start to finish, including the steps of verification, recording, and settlement of transactions. In the context of crowdfunding platforms that use blockchain technology such as Sturan Network, this transaction flow plays an important role in ensuring transparency, security, and efficiency.

The following is an explanation of transaction flow in general in blockchain-based systems, as well as how it is implemented in Sturan Network:

## Transaction Initiation

The transaction flow begins when a user or contributor decides to participate in a crowdfunding campaign. In traditional platforms, contributors usually enter credit card information or other payment details, but in blockchain-based systems, contributors only need to enter their digital wallet address.

    - ### Wallet
        Contributors use digital wallets that contain cryptocurrencies such as Ether (to pay fee). Each of these digital wallets has a unique address that is used to identify the user in blockchain transactions.

    - ### Transaction Submission
        Contributors specify the amount of contribution to be made in the crowdfunding campaign and then send it to the smart contract address.

## Transaction Settlement and Fund Distribution
    - ### Funds Transfer
        At this stage, the smart contract automatically sends funds from the campaign contract address to the recipient's (campaign organizer) wallet address. All parties involved can verify this process by checking the hash and campaign status on the blockchain.

    - ### Final Transaction
        Once the funds are transferred, the transaction is considered final and completed. Blockchain ensures that all transactions that have been verified and recorded in blocks cannot be changed or deleted.
