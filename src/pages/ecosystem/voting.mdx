# Distributed Voting

Sturan Network implements an on-chain voting system that allows the community to participate in every campaign registration decision. By using smart contracts to organize voting, the results are transparent and cannot be manipulated. Every participant can validate the voting results on the blockchain, providing assurance of integrity and trust in the process.
## Direct Voting
    - Take full control of your decisions! With Direct Voting, you can directly vote for the proposals you want to support. During the voting period, the tokens you use for voting will be locked in a smart contract, ensuring that every vote is counted fairly. Once the voting period ends, these tokens will be returned to your account. Your choice directly affects the outcome, ensuring your voice is heard and plays a role in the project's development. If you're someone who enjoys being directly involved in decision-making, this voting option is for you.

## Delegated Voting
    -  Entrust your vote to someone you trust. Through Delegated Voting, you can delegate your vote to another individual who has deeper experience or understanding. Similar to direct voting, the tokens used for voting will be locked in a smart contract during the voting period and will be returned to you afterward. This allows you to participate without having to get involved in every technical detail. Delegate your vote to the best, yet still maintain full control to retract it whenever you wish.

Whether you choose direct voting or delegation, Sturan Network ensures that the voice of the community is at the heart of every decision. Let's take an active role and ensure this project aligns with our shared vision!
