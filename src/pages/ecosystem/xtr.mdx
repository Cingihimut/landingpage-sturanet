# Xtr

XTR is the native token of a decentralized crowdfunding platform that empowers users to actively participate in the decision-making process of campaign creation and management. XTR is used for voting on campaign proposals, giving the community a voice in what causes are launched. It also enables users to bridge between XTR tokens and USX, a stablecoin used for making contributions. The platform prioritizes transparency and equal representation, ensuring that each user's vote counts equally, regardless of the number of tokens they hold
