# Xtr

XTR is the utility token used within Sturan Network. It powers transactions, voting, and governance, ensuring the platform remains decentralized and community-driven.

## Voting on Campaign Proposals
Sturan Network enables decentralized voting on campaign proposals. Community members stake their XTR tokens to vote, ensuring the network’s direction reflects the collective will of the participants.

## Locking Token for Proposal Submitters
To prevent spam and ensure only serious proposals, users submitting campaign proposals must lock XTR tokens. This lock-up ensures that proposals meet the community’s standards.

## Locking Token for Voters
Participants in voting must also lock their XTR tokens during the voting period. After the conclusion of voting, the tokens are returned to their wallets.
